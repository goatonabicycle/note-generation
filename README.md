# note-generation

The point of this project is to help with coming up with random patterns and melodies.
I am one of many guitarists that develop muscle memory for certain patterns when playing.
Hopefully with some random melodies that can be alleviated somewhat!

# Setup

```
 npm install
 run the `dev` and `ui` scripts from `package.json`
```

# Where does this live?

https://note-generation.herokuapp.com/

# Todo:

- Add a mechanism to share this random pattern with others.
- View as sharps or view as flats
- Change Tempo by typing
- Change the starting point (Start from somewhere in the middle of the melody?)
- Add a "pattern mode" (1,2,5) instead of (A, B, E)
- Display these notes relatively to the next notes (ala fl studio piano roll)
- Reverse the set.
- Change individual item in set
- Add a "last ten randomized patterns" view to the right maybe? Store in session/cookie.
- Be able to load up previous random pattern.
- Add multiple random patterns together? (String another 8 bars together)
- Multiple instruments to customize what the notes sound like.
- Export to midi
- Change individual note
- General style improvements
